# Top-Secret Modeling Project

Welcome to the **Top-Secret Modeling** project repository! This project focuses on modeling and analyzing NFL data to make predictions and gain insights into various aspects of the National Football League. The repository contains modular code, classes, scripts, and other resources that contribute to the project's functionality.

## Repository Structure

The repository is organized into several directories, each serving a specific purpose:

- **classes**: This directory contains Python classes that form the core of the project's functionality. These classes handle API requests, database operations, and configuration management.

- **data**: This directory houses the data files used in the project. It's essential for maintaining a clear separation between code and data.

- **docs**: Here you'll find documentation related to the project. This could include API documentation, usage guides, or other project-related information.

- **models**: This directory is dedicated to storing any trained machine learning or statistical models developed as part of the project.

- **scripts**: The scripts directory contains Python scripts that perform various tasks related to the project. These scripts fetch data, conduct exploratory data analysis, train models, make predictions, and more.
