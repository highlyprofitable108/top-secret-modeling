            <h3 class="text-2xl font-bold mb-4 text-gray-800">Overview for
                Dummies:</h3>
            <p class="text-gray-700 mb-4">Building a model is like cooking a
                delicious dish. Just as you'd pick the best ingredients for your
                recipe, in data analysis, you choose the best pieces of
                information (called features) to predict something. In our case,
                we're trying to predict the vegas odds of game spread or total â€“
                that's the difference in scores between two teams in a game.</p>
            <p class="text-gray-700 mb-4">That's where these reports come in!
                They help you understand which features are essential and which
                ones might not be. But remember, just like in cooking,
                understanding your ingredients (or in this case, football) is
                crucial. Knowing the game can help you make better decisions.</p>
            <p class="text-gray-700 mb-4">Later on, we'll use the vegas odds and
                the features we select to run simulations. These simulations
                will help us see how different scenarios might play out in real
                games.</p>
            <p class="text-gray-700"><b>Here's a quick tip:</b> When selecting
                features, search for those that have a strong relationship,
                either positive or negative, with the vegas odds. However,
                exercise caution! If two features are closely related, like rush
                yards and carries, it's often better to choose just one.
                Alternatively, you can use a combined metric like yards per
                carry if it offers valuable insight. The exception is when two
                similar features represent data for different teams; in such
                cases, both can be considered.</p>

                    Ratios, on the other hand, provide a relative measure,
                    indicating how many times one value is compared to another.
                    This can be particularly useful when comparing values of

                    the model contributes to each prediction. They help in

                    indicates higher accuracy. In an ideal scenario, an MAE of 0
                    means perfect predictions, but in practice, a 'good' MAE

                    It ranges from 0 to 1, with higher values indicating a
                    better fit between prediction and reality. An R2 of 1
