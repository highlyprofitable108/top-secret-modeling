            <h3 class="text-2xl font-bold mb-4 text-gray-800">Overview for Dummies:</h3>
            <p class="text-gray-700 mb-4">Imagine you have a magic crystal ball that can tell you which football teams are the best on any day you choose. That's what our "Sim Results" does! It's like a time machine that lets you see which teams were shining stars on a specific day.</p>
            <p class="text-gray-700 mb-4">But wait, there's more! Have you ever played a game where you guess how many candies are in a jar? Our simulator does something similar but for football scores. It makes lots of smart guesses about how a game might end. Then, it shows you the most common guess. It's like having a super-smart friend helping you guess the candies!</p>
            <p class="text-gray-700 mb-4">In short, these reports are your magic tools to understand football better. They show you which teams are the best and what scores we might expect in future games. So, even if football sounds complicated, with our reports, it's as fun and easy as playing with toys or guessing candies!</p>
            <p class="text-gray-700"><b>Here's a quick tip:</b> When you look at the "Power Ranks for Sim Date", think of it as a leaderboard of the best teams for the day you picked. And when you see the "Sim Results Distribution", imagine it's showing you the most likely scores for a game. The higher the bar, the more likely that score is!</p>

                <p class="bg-blue-200 p-4 rounded"><strong>Explain it to a 5-year-old:</strong> Imagine you and your friends are guessing how many candies are in a jar. Some guess too many, some guess too few. The simulator is like a super-smart friend who makes a lot of guesses really quickly. Then, it shows you the most common guess and how sure it is about that guess. This report shows you that special guess about the candies (or in this case, the game score)!</p>
                <p class="bg-gray-300 p-4 rounded"><strong>Note for Advanced Users:</strong> The simulator scoring distribution provides insights into the possible outcomes of a game based on historical data and current team form. It runs thousands of simulations to predict the most likely outcome and the range of possible scores. The projected spread indicates the difference in scores between the two teams, giving users an idea of which team is favored to win and by how much. The results are visualized in a histogram for easy understanding.</p>

                <p class="bg-blue-200 p-4 rounded"><strong>Explain it to a 5-year-old:</strong> Imagine you think a toy is worth 5 coins, but someone tells you it's actually worth 7 coins. That extra value is like a bonus! This report shows you where you might find those bonuses when guessing game scores.</p>
                <p class="bg-gray-300 p-4 rounded"><strong>Note for Advanced Users:</strong> The value opportunity distribution compares the perceived value (like betting odds) with the expected value from the simulations. It helps identify where there might be profitable betting opportunities by highlighting discrepancies between the market's perception and the model's predictions.</p>
