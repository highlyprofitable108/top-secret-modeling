            <h3 class="text-2xl font-bold mb-4 text-gray-800">Overview for Dummies:</h3>
            <p class="text-gray-700 mb-4">Imagine you have a magic crystal ball that can tell you which football teams are the best on any day you choose. That's what our "Sim Results" does! It's like a time machine that lets you see which teams were shining stars on a specific day.</p>
            <p class="text-gray-700 mb-4">But wait, there's more! Have you ever played a game where you guess how many candies are in a jar? Our simulator does something similar but for football scores. It makes lots of smart guesses about how a game might end. Then, it shows you the most common guess. It's like having a super-smart friend helping you guess the candies!</p>
            <p class="text-gray-700 mb-4">In short, these reports are your magic tools to understand football better. They show you which teams are the best and what scores we might expect in future games. So, even if football sounds complicated, with our reports, it's as fun and easy as playing with toys or guessing candies!</p>
            <p class="text-gray-700"><b>Here's a quick tip:</b> When you look at the "Power Ranks for Sim Date", think of it as a leaderboard of the best teams for the day you picked. And when you see the "Sim Results Distribution", imagine it's showing you the most likely scores for a game. The higher the bar, the more likely that score is!</p>

                <h4 class="text-lg font-semibold mb-2 text-gray-800">1. Power Ranks Based on Sim Date Requested:</h4>
                <p class="bg-blue-200 p-4 rounded"><strong>Explain it to a 5-year-old:</strong> Imagine you have a special calendar. On this calendar, you can pick any day you like. Once you pick a day, your magic toy box will show you which toy teams were the best on that day. Maybe on some days, the team that can jump really high is the best, and on other days, the team that can run super fast is the best. This report shows you the best toy teams for the day you picked!</p>
                <p class="bg-gray-300 p-4 rounded"><strong>Note for Advanced Users:</strong> The power ranks based on the sim date requested provide a snapshot of team rankings on a specific date. This allows users to see how teams were performing at any point in the season. The ranking considers various performance metrics up to the selected date, ensuring that the ranking is reflective of the teams' form up to that point. The ranks are then visualized in a bar chart for easy interpretation.</p>

                <p class="bg-blue-200 p-4 rounded"><strong>Explain it to a 5-year-old:</strong> Imagine you and your friends are guessing how many candies are in a jar. Some guess too many, some guess too few. The simulator is like a super-smart friend who makes a lot of guesses really quickly. Then, it shows you the most common guess and how sure it is about that guess. This report shows you that special guess about the candies (or in this case, the game score)!</p>
                <p class="bg-gray-300 p-4 rounded"><strong>Note for Advanced Users:</strong> The simulator scoring distribution provides insights into the possible outcomes of a game based on historical data and current team form. It runs thousands of simulations to predict the most likely outcome and the range of possible scores. The projected spread indicates the difference in scores between the two teams, giving users an idea of which team is favored to win and by how much. The results are visualized in a histogram for easy understanding.</p>
